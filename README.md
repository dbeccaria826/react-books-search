<h1>Book Search with Google Books API</h1>

### A simple application for searching for book information using Google Books API

## Current Tech:
* ReactJS - Front
* Nodejs + express - Back
* MongoDB - database

## Checklist (2020): 

* [] Remove react-strap from the front-end and use custom CSS for better performance overall
* [] Use an appropriate pattern in css to organize the results returned from the search. (i.e. grid or flexbox)
* [] Re-examine the use of MVC paradigm for backend operations.
* [] Rethink using mongodb for this and possibly switch to a different database such as firebase or sql.
